--- abstract

   <EDITOR NOTE: This document does not change the status (MUST, MAY,
   RECOMMENDED, etc) of any of the algorithms listed in [RFC8624]; that is
   the work of future documents.  Instead, this document moves
   the canonical list of algorithms from [RFC8624] to an IANA registry.
   This is done for two reasons: 1) to allow the list to be updated more
   easily, and, much more importantly, 2) to allow the list to be more
   easily referenced.>

   The DNSSEC protocol makes use of various cryptographic algorithms to provide
   authentication of DNS data and proof of non-existence.  To ensure
   interoperability between DNS resolvers and DNS authoritative servers, it is
   necessary to specify both a set of algorithm implementation requirements and
   usage guidelines to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all
   implementations support.  This document updates RFC8624 by moving the
   canonical source of algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance
   for DNSSEC from [RFC8624] to an IANA registry.  Future extensions
   to this registry can be made under new, incremental update RFCs.

# Introduction

   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC9364] is used to provide
   authentication of DNS data. The DNSSEC signing algorithms are
   defined by various RFCs, including [RFC4034], [RFC4509], [RFC5155],
   [RFC5702], [RFC5933], [RFC6605], [RFC8080].

   To ensure interoperability, a set of "mandatory-to-implement"
   DNSKEY algorithms are defined in [RFC8624].  To make the current
   status of the algorithms more easily accessible and understandable,
   and to make future changes to these recommendations easier to
   publish, this document moves the canonical status of the algorithms
   from [RFC8624] to the IANA DNSSEC algorithm registries.
   Additionally, as advice to operators, it adds recommendations for
   deploying and the usage of these algorithms.

   <Editor: This is similar to the process used for the
   [TLS-ciphersuites] registry, where the canonical list of
   ciphersuites is in the IANA registry, and the RFCs reference the
   IANA registry.>

##  Document Audience

   The recommendations columns added to the "DNS Security Algorithm
   Numbers" and "Digest Algorithms" IANA tables target DNSSEC
   operators and implementers.

   Implementations need to meet both high security expectations as
   well as provide interoperability between various vendors and with
   different versions.

   The field of cryptography evolves continuously.  New, stronger
   algorithms appear, and existing algorithms may be found to be less
   secure then originally thought.  Therefore, algorithm
   implementation requirements and usage guidance need to be updated
   from time to time in order to reflect the new reality, and to allow for a
   smooth transition to more secure algorithms, as well as deprecation of algorithms deemed to no longer be secure.

   Cryptographic algorithm choices implemented in and required by
   software must be conservative to minimize the risk of algorithm
   compromise.

   The perspective of implementers may differ from that of an operator
   who wishes to deploy and configure DNSSEC with only the safest
   algorithm.  As such this document also adds new recommendations
   about which algorithms should be deploy regardless of
   implementation status. In general it is expected that deployment
   of aging algorithms should generally be reduced before
   implementations stop supporting them.

##  Updating Algorithm Requirement Levels

   By the time a DNSSEC cryptographic algorithm is made
   mandatory-to-implement, it should already be available in most
   implementations.  This document defines an IANA registration
   modification to allow future documents to specify the
   implementation recommendations for each algorithm, as the
   recommendation status of each DNSSEC cryptographic algorithm is
   expected to change over time.  For example, there is no guarantee
   that newly introduced algorithms will become mandatory-to-implement
   in the future.  Likewise, published algorithms are continuously
   subjected to cryptographic attack and may become too weak, or even
   be completely broken, and will require deprecation in the future.

   It is expected that the deprecation of an algorithm will be performed
   gradually.  This provides time for implementations to update
   their implemented algorithms while remaining interoperable.  Unless
   there are strong security reasons, an algorithm is expected to be
   downgraded from MUST to NOT RECOMMENDED or MAY, instead of directly
   from MUST to MUST NOT.  Similarly, an algorithm that has not been
   mentioned as mandatory-to-implement is expected to be first introduced
   as RECOMMENDED instead of a MUST.

   Since the effect of using an unknown DNSKEY algorithm is that the
   zone is treated as insecure, it is recommended that algorithms which have been downgraded to NOT RECOMMENDED or lower not be used by authoritative
   nameservers and DNSSEC signers to create new DNSKEY's.  This will
   allow for deprecated algorithms to become used less and less over
   time.  Once an algorithm has reached a sufficiently low level of
   deployment, it can be marked as MUST NOT, so that recursive resolvers
   can remove support for validating it.

   Validating recursive resolvers are encouraged to retain support for all
   algorithms not marked as MUST NOT.

## Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear
   in all capitals, as shown here.

   [RFC2119] considers the term SHOULD equivalent to RECOMMENDED, and
   SHOULD NOT equivalent to NOT RECOMMENDED.  The authors of this
   document have chosen to use the terms RECOMMENDED and NOT
   RECOMMENDED, as this more clearly expresses the recommendations to
   implementers.

# Adding usage and implementation recommendations to the IANA DNSSEC tables

   Per this document, the following columns are being added to the
   following DNSSEC algorithm tables registered with IANA:

   |-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
   | Table                             | Column added                     |
   |-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
   | Domain Security Algorithm Numbers | Use for DNSSSEC Signing          |
   |-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
   | Domain Security Algorithm Numbers | Use for DNSSSEC Validation       |
   |-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
   | Domain Security Algorithm Numbers | Implement for DNSSSEC Signing    |
   |-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
   | Domain Security Algorithm Numbers | Implement for DNSSSEC Validation |
   |-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
   | Digest Algorithm                  | Use for DNSSSEC Delegation       |
   |-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
   | Digest Algorithm                  | Use for DNSSSEC Validation       |
   |-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
   | Digest Algorithm                  | Implement for DNSSSEC Delegation |
   |-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
   | Digest Algorithm                  | Implement for DNSSSEC Validation |
   |-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|

   Adding a new entry to the "DNS System Algorithm Numbers" registry
   with a recommended value of MAY in the "Use for DNSSSEC Signing",
   "Use for DNSSSEC Validation", "Implement for DNSSSEC Signing", or
   "Implement for DNSSSEC Validation" columns requires RFC
   publication.  Adding a new entry to, or changing existing values in,
   the "DNS System Algorithm Numbers" registry for the "Use for
   DNSSSEC Signing", "Use for DNSSSEC Validation", "Implement for
   DNSSSEC Signing", or "Implement for DNSSSEC Validation" columns to
   any other value than MAY requires a Standards Action.

   Adding a new entry to the "Digest Algorithms" registry with a
   recommended value of MAY in the "Use for DNSSSEC Delegation", "Use
   for DNSSSEC Validation", "Implement for DNSSSEC Delegation", or
   "Implement for DNSSSEC Validation" columns requires RFC
   publication.  Adding a new entry to, or changing existing values in,
   the "DNS System Algorithm Numbers" registry for the "Use for
   DNSSSEC Delegation", "Use for DNSSSEC Validation", "Implement for
   DNSSSEC Delegation", or "Implement for DNSSSEC Validation" columns
   to any other value than MAY requires a Standards Action.

   If an item is not marked as "RECOMMENDED", it does not necessarily
   mean that it is flawed; rather, it indicates that the item either
   has not been through the IETF consensus process, has limited
   applicability, or is intended only for specific use cases.

   The following sections state the initial values to be populated
   into these rows, with Implementation values transcribed from
   [RFC8624].  Use for columns was also set to the same values from
   [RFC8624], as there is no existing documented values and general
   interpretation of the tables to date indicate they should be the
   same, although may differ in the future.

#  DNS System Algorithm Numbers Column Values

   Initial recommendation columns of use and implementation
   recommendations for the "Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC)
   Algorithm Numbers" are shown in Table 2.  When there are multiple
   RECOMMENDED algorithms in the "use" column, operators should choose
   the best algorithm according to local policy.

   <Editor's note: A space was deliberately added to "RSASHA1-NSEC3-
   SHA1" to make the table fit within the standard internet draft text
   width.  Additionally the algorithm number column was abbreviated to
   'N'.>

#  Security Considerations

   This document makes no modifications to the security of the
   existing protocol or recommendations described in [RFC8624].  Thus
   the security considerations remain the same, which we quote below.

   The security of cryptographic systems depends on both the strength of
   the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the strength of the keys used
   with those algorithms.  The security also depends on the engineering
   of the protocol used by the system to ensure that there are no non-
   cryptographic ways to bypass the security of the overall system.

   This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic
   algorithms for the use of DNSSEC, specifically with the selection
   of "mandatory-to-implement" algorithms.  The algorithms identified
   in this document as MUST or RECOMMENDED to implement are not known
   to be broken at the current time, and cryptographic research so far
   leads us to believe that they are likely to remain secure into the
   foreseeable future.  However, this isn't necessarily forever, and
   it is expected that future documents will be issued from time to
   time to reflect the current best practices in this area.

   Retiring an algorithm too soon would result in a zone signed with the
   retired algorithm being downgraded to the equivalent of an unsigned
   zone.  Therefore, algorithm deprecation must be done very slowly and
   only after careful consideration and measurement of its use.

#  Operational Considerations

   DNSKEY algorithm rollover in a live zone is a complex process.  See
   [RFC6781] and [RFC7583] for guidelines on how to perform algorithm
   rollovers.

   DS algorithm rollover in a live zone is also a complex process.
   Upgrading algorithm at the same time as rolling the new KSK key will
   lead to DNSSEC validation failures, and users MUST upgrade the DS
   algorithm first before rolling the Key Signing Key.

#  IANA Considerations

  The IANA is requested to update the [DNSKEY-IANA] and [DS-IANA] registries
  according to the following sections.

## Update to the "DNS Security Algorithm Numbers" table

  This document requests IANA update the "DNS Security Algorithm
  Numbers" registry ([DNSKEY-IANA]) table with the following
  additional columns:

  * "Use for DNSSEC Signing"
  * "Use for DNSSEC Validation"
  * "Implement for DNSSEC Signing"
  * "Implement for DNSSEC Validation"

  These values should be populated using values from Table 2 of this
  document.

  Additional, the registration policy for the [DNSKEY-IANA] registry
  should match the text describing the requirements in this document.

## Update to the "Digest Algorithms" table

  This document requests IANA update the "Digest Algorithms" registry
  ([DS-IANA]) table with the following additional columns:

  * "Use for DNSSEC Delegation"
  * "Use for DNSSEC Validation"
  * "Implement for DNSSEC Delegation"
  * "Implement for DNSSEC Validation"

  These values should be populated using values from Table 3 of this
  document.

  * Update the registration policy for the [DNSKEY-IANA] registry to
    match the text describing update requirements above.
